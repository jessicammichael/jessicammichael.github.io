You're probably wondering why I am writing about this as it really isn't about coding. But truth of the matter is that it actually does involve you and your journey of coding from start to finish. 

I am no doctor in any means, therefore I am going to cite my source(s) below!

I do think this is very important to talk about as I believe mental health is a very important thing to keep up with. I had no idea what this was until I started school here and one of my teachers told me about it. I already struggle with various mental health issues and this is something that sure doesn't help me sometimes. I like to be very open with mental health because I feel it is important for everyone to know that they're not alone in this! I can ramble on about why I want to post about this and why I love to share personal stories and/or victories with people who are struggling as well. But!! I'll try to keep it short and sweet.

*What is it?* It is a psychological pattern in your brain where you doubt your own accomplishments and have an internalized fear of being a fraud. You might believe that you didn't get where you are based on your accomplishments and feel that you have deceived people into thinking that you're an intelligent person when you feel that you really aren't.

*Who experiences it?* Just about anyone! It can be accompanied by anxiety, stress, depression, low self-esteem, family expectations, overprotective parents, etc. Sometimes, if there are feelings of guilt it may result in a fear of success. A couple examples are being acknowledged by others for success and believe that it's not fair/right to be in a better situation than a friend or loved one. 

*Why do we experience it?* This can also be answered in who experiences it. Our brains can be so smart but so deceitful at the same time. 

I do hope this brings some clarity to at least one person! It's always good to have a name to something you are experiencing.
