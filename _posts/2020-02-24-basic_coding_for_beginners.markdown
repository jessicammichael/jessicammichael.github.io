Ever start learning how to code and you find very strange vocabulary that you'd never expect to see as a developer? Hey, me too!

I am currently enrolled at Flatiron School, an awesome and fun coding course! While the course may be intense at times, I find myself wondering why some of these words were placed here to describe different objects or methods. Also, I tend to find myself being like "wow, so this is why this symbol is on the keyboard, huh."

Below will be some vocabulary from a wild language called Ruby:

**IRB**: Interactive Ruby - who is she? This is basically a room where you can talk to Ruby. Weird, right? Who wants to talk to a computer? Pffftt.

**Boolean**: Sounds like a cute ghost but alas, this is coding! This is a logical statement that can be either true or false. They can compare data of any type as long as they are the same type of basic data. Spooky!!

**Logical Operator**: You use these bad boys to compare boolean values. Some of the operators include 'or', '| |', '&&', and 'not.' I am only doing some basic vocabulary right now! We can get into the world of operators and methods, and everything else in between in the upcoming blog posts! So hit that follow button!

**Hashes**: In the world of technology, it's hard not to think about a hashtag but guess what? This is coding and a hashtag won't be used in this segment. Hashes are a collection of key-value pairs. Simple as that!

**Strings**: Strings are cool in Ruby! You can store and use them to manipulate data. They are mutable which means that you can change them in one place instead of creating a whole brand new one! Do *not* forget about the quotes!! Single or double are okay as long as they match! You can't have a string without those quotes so a lifeline if you will.

The beauty of all of this is that it can be accessed right through your fingertips!! Programming is super fun and difficult at times but very rewarding!
